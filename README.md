# Calculator
This calculator has a limitation: it only works with two numbers per time, so if  you want to input another number, you'll have to clear and try again. So, the syntax would be [num_left_Side] [operation_to_be_used] [num_right_Side]] then [equal]. That's basically how the calculator works.
